HN26 There are some common themes in the cases: statistics play an important role in a plaintiffs' ability to make a prima facie case of pattern-or-practice discrimination; experts should carefully formulate their initial hypotheses; experts should consider variables other than the salient characteristic and their failure to do so weakens and renders less probative their conclusions. But particularly when plaintiffs have other evidence (such as individual testimony about personal experiences of discrimination), the weight of decision seems to treat failure to consider other variables as a factor going to the weight of the statistical evidence and not as a factor that renders the evidence inadmissible. The court concludes that Neumark's failure to follow what the Seventh Circuit appears to deem \"best practices\" by failing to consider variables other than the salient factor of race does not render his opinions so unreliable that the statistical evidence is irrelevant [*132]  on that basis alone. The court concludes that if the only flaw in Neumark's methodology had been his failure to account for variables other than race, the evidence would have been relevant to the plaintiffs' allegations that Infosys discriminated under Rule 401's \"liberal,\" basic standard of relevance, Daubert, 509 U.S. at 587, and the defendants' criticisms would go to the probative value, or weight, that the trier of fact should give that evidence.16\n",

But a statistical study that fails to correct for salient explanatory variables, or even to make the most elementary comparisons, has no value as causal explanation and  [*538]  is therefore inadmissible in a federal court. The idea that the educational deficiencies of minority students in the Rockford public schools are due primarily to discrimination by the school authorities and can be rectified by an equitable decree is at once unsubstantiated by responsible evidence and--since there is no evidence that these deficiencies are any greater than in school districts around the country that have not been held to have discriminated against minority students-- implausible.\n\nTracking might be adopted in order to segregate the races. The well-known correlation between race and academic performance makes tracking, even when implemented in accordance with strictly objective criteria, a pretty effective segregator. If tracking were adopted for this purpose, then enjoining tracking would be a proper as well as the natural remedy for this form of intentional discrimination, at least if there were no compelling evidence that it improves the academic performance of minority children and if the possible benefits to the better students and the social interest [**28]  in retaining them in the public schools were given little weight. The general view is that tracking does not benefit minority students, Daniel U. Levine & Rayna F. Levine, Society and Education 38-41 (9th ed. 1996), although there is evidence that some of them do benefit. Adam Gamoran & Robert D. Mare, \"Secondary School Tracking and Educational Inequality: Compensation, Reinforcement, or Neutrality?\" 94 Am. J. Sociology 1146, 1177 (1989). All this is neither here nor there. The plaintiffs' argument is not that the school district adopted tracking way back when in order to segregate the schools. It is that it misused tracking, twisting the criteria to achieve greater segregation than objective tracking alone would have done. See 851 F. Supp. at 913-14. The school district should be enjoined from doing this--not, on this record, enjoined from tracking.",

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993), governing the admissibility of expert testimony, which requires the district judge to satisfy himself that the expert is being as careful as he would be in his regular professional work outside his paid litigation consulting. E.g., Braun v. Lorillard Inc., 84 F.3d 230, 234-35 (7th Cir. 1996); Rosen v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., 78 F.3d 316, 318 (7th Cir. 1996); Daubert v.

Although the expert used standard statistical methods for determining whether there was a significant correlation between age and retention for the 17 persons on the list, see Michael O. Finkelstein & Bruce Levin, Statistics for Lawyers 157 (1990) (Fisher's exact test), the omission of Sebring and Shulman from the sample tested was arbitrary. The expert should at least have indicated the sensitivity of his analysis to these omissions. More important is the expert's failure to correct for any potential explanatory variables other than age. Completely ignored was the more than remote possibility that age was correlated with a legitimate job-related qualification, such as familiarity with computers. Everyone knows that younger people are on average more comfortable with computers than older people are, just as older people are on average more comfortable with manual-shift cars than younger people are. Three weeks of training might go some distance toward closing the computer-literacy gap, yet it would be more surprising than otherwise if so short a period of training could close the gap completely. The expert could easily [**8]  have inquired about the feasibility of ascertaining through discovery the history of the use of computers by each of the employees on the list of 17.",

      "facts": "Mariner's [**21]  explanation is not so convincing as to render Integra's explanation implausible at the pleading stage. Integra sought to control for, inter alia, the \"access to care available to the [SNF] patients\" sampled in its models through the use of county-level demographic variables (e.g., unemployment rate, percent of population without a high school diploma, log median income). See FAC \u00b6 95 (Equation 1, Panels A and B). But even if Integra did not explicitly factor a more difficult locus of discharge into its regression model, the likelihood that locus of discharge would be the cause of the higher rate of UHR across all 58 principal diagnosis codes (with a sample size of over 13 million SNF admissions) is not so obvious as to render Integra's explanation implausible.

The statistics and regression analyses presented in the complaint raise a fair inference of causation. While the defendants' critique of the investigation's composite variables also may have some merit, see NFHA v. U.S. Bank, N.A., No. 01-12-0283-8 (HUD Jan. 8, 2016), Bank of America Mot. Dismiss, Ex. 1, ECF No. 44-3, they do not defeat the well-pled factual contention that the defendants' delegation of its maintenance responsibilities\u2014in the aggregate\u2014caused disparate racial impact. The other factors considered in the City of Miami proximate [**39]  cause calculus do not change this result. While the risk of additional plaintiffs and multiple recoveries may be marginally greater than that in City of Miami where the city was the only injured party, the risk is mitigated by the necessary investigative depth and statistical sophistication required to bring a disparate impact claim. See City of Miami, 923 F.3d 1286-87. By the same token, it is hard to imagine a plaintiff better situated to bring these claims than a group of the nation's, preeminent nonprofit fair housing organizations. See id. at 1288-89.

Independent variables represent the possible \"causes\" of the \"effect\" being studied. If the study does not contemplate the results of manipulating various independent variables, it does little to prove causation. That is because the real cause of the observed results may be variables other than the one with which the dependent variable is associated. When an association is identified among variables, a controlled experiment will help identify which independent variable caused the effect. In fact, this is the best way to eliminate other variables as possible causes of observed associations. Id. at 347. If a controlled experiment [**31]  is not conducted, then the investigator should at least measure the group in which the effect occurred against a comparable group in which the effect is not expected or observed. See id. at 349.

That method would be valid if it is reasonable to assume that the job skills the defendants needed to retain were equally distributed across age groups. See Barnes, 896 F.2d at 1466. If it is not reasonable so to assume, a defendant can show that the statistical method is faulty, or that chance does explain the discrepancy, and the statistical evidence may lose its effectiveness altogether. Id. at 1469.

The Court finds that the statistical evidence presented, in combination with the other circumstantial evidence (e.g., that Muslim employees' use of unscheduled breaks to pray was targeted for discipline), is sufficient for the Court to infer a pattern or practice of discriminatory discipline on the basis of black race and Muslim religion during Ramadan 2008. See Pitre, 843 F.2d at 1267. The Court, however, finds that the EEOC has not shown a prima facie case that there is a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of Somali national origin. The non-statistical circumstantial evidence of prejudice and discrimination was tied to race and religion. While national origin undoubtably played a role in cultural tensions at the Greeley plant in 2008, there was little, if any, evidence linking discipline or harassment in the [**113]  Greeley plant to anything particular to Somali nationals as a protected class apart from their black race or Muslim religion.35 In particular, the Court finds that the weaker statistical correlation between Somali national origin (using the January 1 birth date proxy) indicates that any pattern or practice of discrimination was on account of such employees' other protected characteristics. The statistical evidence shows less of a correlation between Somali nationality and discipline than the other protected characteristics. It is reasonable to inf er based on the circumstantial evidence that, to the extent discrimination occurred, black race and Muslim religion were the basis for any pattern or practice of discrimination, not Somali national origin.",

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 152, 154.

Thus, Kelley's allegation that she was treated disparately from white and male colleagues does not give rise to a circumstantial inference of discrimination. Because Kelley has not plausibly alleged facts supporting the fourth element of a prima facie claim of unlawful race and gender discrimination under Title VII, Count III must be dismissed. [**44] ",

Cashion, 588 F.3d 959, 962 (8th Cir. 2009))). The record shows that the first of the three Assistant Front Office Managers Atrium hired was a former Atrium employee with a great track record at the company who had left to attend hospitality school. The second had an undergraduate degree in event management. And the third served as a Night Auditor at another hotel for five years, which both parties acknowledge represents management experience. In contrast, Carter had no formal hospitality or event management education, lacked management experience, and received a number of disciplinary write-ups from Atrium before being passed over [**13]  for promotion. In addition, the record shows that Atrium has hired Black men for the Assistant Front Office Manager position in the past. Even drawing all reasonable inferences in Carter's favor, after a careful review of the record we conclude that he has not presented evidence to show that Atrium's stated reason for declining to promote him was \"not the true reason,\" but rather a \"pretext for discrimination.\" Kim v. Nash Finch Co., 123 F.3d 1046, 1056 (8th Cir. 1997) (quoting Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affs. v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)).

      "facts": "Plaintiff's race discrimination claim fails to meet these standards. Under the third prong of the pleading standard, Plaintiff was required to provide sufficient factual allegations to support a plausible inference of race discrimination. The Amended [*16]  Complaint, however, is devoid of any such factual material. Although she alleges that she was repeatedly mistreated by her supervisors, ECF No. 17-2 at 3-9, there are no facts alleged from which it can be plausibly inferred that the mistreatment was racially motivated. While the Amended Complaint generally avers that \"[s]imilarly situated co-workers outside of the [her] race were not treated in the manner in which [she] was,\" id. at 9, Plaintiff offers no facts to back that up, rendering the allegation \"just a legal conclusion\u2014and a legal conclusion is never enough.\" SS & T, LLC v.

Indeed, nowhere does the Amended Complaint even generally describe any comparator employees, how they were similarly situated, or how they were treated differently than Plaintiff. Other courts in this [*17]  District and elsewhere have not hesitated to dismiss disparate treatment Title VII claims with comparable pleading deficiencies. See, e.g., Beaulieu v.

If Lewis was threatened with a suspension for trying to exercise her collective bargaining rights, [**51]  that is a separate (and perhaps troubling) issue.

He doesn't, for example, offer up a white store manager\u2014or, for that matter, any other employee\u2014who yelled at several coworkers (sometimes in front of customers) while throwing merchandise and who, despite this misconduct, wasn't fired. In fact, the record supports the exact opposite conclusion. As Schiller, the ethics case manager, testified: \"[T]he determination was made to terminate Marcellus based on his pattern of harassing and intimidating behavior in his store. And that termination is very consistent with  [*1246]  how we would treat other store managers who behaved the same way.\" Schiller Depo. at 51:7-11 (emphasis added). Despite having over nine months to develop the factual record in this case, Wills hasn't adduced a single piece of evidence to rebut this proposition. And that's sufficient to dispose of Wills's McDonnell Douglas claim here. See, e.g., Holmes v. City of Ft. Pierce, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2607, 2022 WL 247976, at *6 (11th Cir.

That the plaintiff did not pursue arbitration constitutes a major difference.

Plaintiff argues that the \"union let [his] case fall by the wayside.\" ECF No. 24-2, pg. 13. But  [*82]  even if true, that has no bearing on this analysis. The plaintiff's claims allege that WMATA officials treated him disparately from other officers by not reinstating him, not that his union representatives treated him poorly. It is also important to note another difference between the plaintiff and M.S., S.B., and N.M.

Plaintiff has not argued that Defendant lacked legitimate business reasons for the 2015 raise, the 2015 RIF ratings, or the subsequent termination. Likewise, Plaintiff has not argued that Defendant's stated reasons were a pretext for retaliation. Conversely, Defendant has established that it gave similar raises to similarly situated employees, honestly rated Plaintiff's job competencies in the 2015 RIF, and non-discriminatorily selected to terminate Plaintiff's employment. Plaintiff presents no evidence that Defendant's actions were actually driven by retaliatory intent. Instead, Plaintiff appears to rely on the same actions he argues establish pretext for intentional race and national origin discrimination. But the Court has already rejected those arguments as insufficient to establish pretext for Plaintiff's discrimination claims and they similarly fail with regard to his retaliation claims.
